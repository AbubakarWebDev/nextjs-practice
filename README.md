# Next.js Blog Management System

This repository hosts a Blog Management System built with Next.js. The project demonstrates how to create a full-stack application using Next.js, including server-side rendering (SSR), API routes, and dynamic content management.

## Features

- **Dynamic Blog Management**: Create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
- **API Routes**: Handle CRUD operations via Next.js API endpoints.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improved SEO and fast initial load.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **State Management**: Manage application state effectively.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbubakarWebDev/nextjs-blog-management-system.git
   cd nextjs-blog-management-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### API Endpoints

- **GET /api/posts**: Retrieve all blog posts.
- **POST /api/posts**: Create a new blog post. 
  - Body example:

    {
      "title": "Updated Blog Post",
      "content": "This is the updated content."
    }
    ```
- **DELETE /api/posts/:id**: Delete a specific blog post by ID.
